        <h2>Here's a time line of Katharine Hepburn's life:</h2>
        <ul class="font-info-content">
            <li><strong>1928–1932 (Breaking into theatre): </strong> Hepburn left university determined to become an actress. The day after graduating, she traveled to Baltimore to meet Edwin H. Knopf, who ran a successful stock theatre company. Impressed
                by her eagerness, Knopf cast Hepburn in his current production,
                <I>The Czarina</I>. Nevertheless,
                <I>The Warrior's Husband</I> proved to be Hepburn's breakout performance. Biographer Charles Higham states that the role was ideal for the actress, requiring an aggressive energy and athleticism. Hepburn received positive reviews from the show.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1932–1934 (Hollywood success): </strong>A scout for the Hollywood agent Leland Hayward spotted Hepburn's appearance in
                <I>The Warrior's Husband</I>, and asked her to test for the part of Sydney Fairfield in the upcoming RKO film
                <I>A Bill of Divorcement</I>. Director George Cukor was impressed by what he saw: "There was this odd creature", he recalled, "she was unlike anybody I'd ever heard." Offered the role, Hepburn demanded $1,500 a week, a large amount for an unknown actress. The picture
                was a success and Hepburn received positive reviews. Hepburn's third picture confirmed her as a major actress in Hollywood. For playing aspiring actress Eva Lovelace in
                <I>Morning Glory</I>, she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. By the end of 1933, Hepburn was a respected film actress, but she yearned to prove herself on Broadway.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1934–1938 (Career setbacks): </strong>Hepburn tried to return to Broardway with
                <I>The Lake</I> but this proved to be a flop, as well as other historial vehicules like
                <I>Mary of Scotland</I> (1936),
                <I>A Woman Rebels</I> (1936), and
                <I>Quality Street</I> (1937). Hepburn recovered some lost ground with her sparkling performances in the screwball comedies
                <I>Bringing Up Baby</I> (1938) and
                <I>Holiday</I> (1938), both of which also starred Cary Grant. However, it was too late: a group of leading film exhibitors had already written off Hepburn as “box office poison.”</li>
            <li><strong>1939–1942 (Revival): </strong> Following this decline in her career, Hepburn took action to create her own comeback vehicle. She left Hollywood to look for a stage project, and signed on to star in Philip Barry's new play,
                <I>The Philadelphia Story</I>. It was a huge hit, and she purchased the motion picture rights to the play. The 1940 film version—in which she reteamed with Cukor and Grant—was a critical and commercial success, and it jump-started her Hollywood career. She continued
                to make periodic returns to the stage (notably as the title character in the 1969 Broadway musical <i>Coco</i>), but Hepburn remained essentially a film actor for the remainder of her career. During this period Hepburn was also known for
                her role in
                <I>Women of the Year</I>.
            </li>
